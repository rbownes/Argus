# LLM Evaluation Framework

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). As LLMs become increasingly integrated into various applicationsâfrom chatbots and virtual assistants to content creation and code generationâensuring their reliability, accuracy, and ethical behavior is paramount.

This framework offers tools, metrics, and protocols for thorough LLM evaluation, helping developers and researchers assess model performance, detect biases, and ensure ethical outputs.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Metrics Suite**: Evaluate LLMs using ground truth-based metrics, text generation metrics, and specialized evaluation criteria
- **Flexible Evaluation Protocols**: Implement train-test splits, cross-validation techniques, and human evaluation processes
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Track model performance, detect anomalies, and analyze user feedback in real-time
- **Semantic Drift Detection**: Identify and mitigate changes in meaning that can affect model outputs over time
- **LLM-as-a-Judge Capabilities**: Leverage other LLMs to evaluate model outputs in a scalable way

## Metrics Included

### Ground Truth-Based Metrics
- Answer Relevance
- QA Correctness

### Text Generation Metrics
- BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)
- ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)
- METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering)

### Other Metrics
- Accuracy
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Coherence
- Perplexity
- BERTScore
- Latency
- Toxicity Assessment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-evaluation.git
cd llm-evaluation

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from llm_evaluation import Evaluator

# Initialize the evaluator with your model
evaluator = Evaluator(model="your-model-name")

# Run a basic evaluation
results = evaluator.evaluate(
    dataset="your-dataset",
    metrics=["accuracy", "latency", "toxicity"]
)

# View the results
print(results.summary())
```

## Evaluation Protocols

The framework supports multiple evaluation protocols:

1. **Train-Test Split**: Divide your dataset into training and testing subsets
2. **Cross-Validation**: Use various cross-validation techniques:
   - Holdout Validation
   - K-Fold Cross Validation
   - Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)
   - Stratified Cross-Validation
3. **Human Evaluation**: Incorporate human feedback using structured evaluation forms

## Advanced Features

### LLM-as-a-Judge

Use powerful LLMs to evaluate the outputs of other models:

```python
from llm_evaluation import LLMJudge

# Initialize the judge
judge = LLMJudge(model="judge-model-name")

# Evaluate outputs
scores = judge.evaluate(
    outputs=model_outputs,
    criteria=["relevance", "accuracy", "coherence"]
)
```

### Real-time Monitoring

Monitor your LLM in production:

```python
from llm_evaluation import Monitor

# Initialize the monitor
monitor = Monitor(model="your-model-name")

# Start monitoring
monitor.start(
    metrics=["latency", "toxicity", "hallucination"],
    alert_threshold=0.8
)
```

### Semantic Drift Detection

Track and manage semantic drift:

```python
from llm_evaluation import DriftDetector

# Initialize the detector
detector = DriftDetector()

# Check for drift
drift_report = detector.check(
    model="your-model-name",
    reference_data="baseline-data",
    current_data="current-data"
)
```

## Building a Custom Evaluation Framework

To build a custom evaluation framework:

1. **Define Objectives**: Clearly define what aspects of LLM performance you want to assess
2. **Select Metrics**: Choose appropriate evaluation metrics aligned with your objectives
3. **Create Test Cases**: Develop diverse test cases covering various scenarios
4. **Implement Scoring**: Create consistent scoring mechanisms for each metric
5. **Automate Evaluation**: Streamline testing and integrate with CI/CD pipelines
6. **Analyze and Iterate**: Use evaluation results to improve your LLM applications

## Open-Source Tools Integration

This framework integrates with several popular open-source evaluation tools:

- **DeepEval**: For summarization accuracy and hallucination detection
- **Opik by Comet**: For tracking, annotation, and refinement across environments
- **RAGAs**: For evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines
- **Deepchecks**: For dataset bias detection and model performance assessment
- **Evalverse**: For unified evaluation and collaboration integration
