Panopticon is a comprehensive system for evaluating and benchmarking language model (LLM) performance across diverse tasks and criteria. Built on a microservices architecture, it enables organizations to systematically test, evaluate, and compare multiple language models using customizable evaluation metrics.

## What Panopticon Accomplishes

Panopticon addresses the challenge of objectively measuring and comparing LLM performance by providing:

1. **Structured Evaluation Framework**: Organize evaluation queries by themes and taxonomies (e.g., reasoning, creativity, safety)
2. **Multi-Model Assessment**: Compare performance across different LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
3. **Customizable Metrics**: Define and store evaluation criteria tailored to specific use cases
4. **Automated Judgment**: Leverage LLMs themselves as judges with well-crafted evaluation prompts
5. **Comprehensive Analytics**: Visualize performance trends, comparisons, and detailed results
6. **Semantic Search**: Find similar queries and evaluation metrics through vector embeddings
7. **Extensible Architecture**: Easily integrate new models, evaluation methods, and visualization types

Panopticon helps machine learning teams, AI safety researchers, and organizations developing LLM-powered applications to:

- Identify relative strengths and weaknesses of different models across task categories
- Track performance improvements over time as models are updated
- Detect regressions in specific capability areas
- Make data-driven decisions about which models to deploy for particular use cases
- Optimize prompting strategies based on evaluation feedback

## System Architecture

Panopticon employs a modular microservices architecture that ensures separation of concerns and enables independent scaling of each component.

### Service Communication Architecture

Panopticon implements a proper microservice communication pattern where services communicate with each other via well-defined HTTP APIs rather than direct imports. This architecture:

1. **Maintains Service Isolation**: Each service operates independently with its own database instances
2. **Prevents Resource Conflicts**: Avoids issues with shared resources like ChromaDB instances
3. **Improves Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on load
4. **Enhances Resilience**: Services can handle failures of other services gracefully

The system uses a shared HTTP client utility (`shared/service_client.py`) that provides:
- Standardized error handling
- Consistent authentication
- Logging for API calls between services

Each service that needs to communicate with other services has client wrappers that provide type-safe methods for interacting with those services. For example, the Judge Service has client wrappers for the Query Storage and Evaluation Storage services.

## End-to-End Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Monitoring Model Performance Over Time

This workflow demonstrates how to track a model's performance across multiple evaluation runs.

#### 1. Store Test Queries

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/queries \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev_api_key_for_testing" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement to a high school student.",
    "theme": "science_explanations",
    "metadata": {
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "target_audience": "high_school",
      "topic": "physics"
    }
  }'
```

Repeat for multiple queries within the same theme.

#### 2. Create Evaluation Metrics

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/v1/evaluation-metrics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev_api_key_for_testing" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Evaluate this explanation on clarity. Does it clearly explain the concept without using unnecessarily complex terminology? Is it appropriate for the target audience (high school students)? Rate on a scale of 1-10.",
    "metric_type": "clarity",
    "metadata": {
      "importance": "high",
      "target_audience": "high_school"
    }
  }'
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/v1/evaluation-metrics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev_api_key_for_testing" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Evaluate this explanation on scientific accuracy. Are there any factual errors or misleading simplifications? Rate on a scale of 1-10.",
    "metric_type": "accuracy",
    "metadata": {
      "importance": "critical",
      "domain": "physics"
    }
  }'
```

#### 3. Run Initial Evaluation

Evaluate all queries in a theme against a specific model:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/api/v1/evaluate/theme \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev_api_key_for_testing" \
  -d '{
    "theme": "science_explanations",
    "model_id": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18",
    "evaluation_prompt_ids": ["clarity", "accuracy"],
    "judge_model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18"
  }'
```

#### 4. Run Evaluation After Model Update

Wait for a model update (e.g., new GPT-4 version), then run the same evaluation again:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/api/v1/evaluate/theme \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev_api_key_for_testing" \
  -d '{
    "theme": "science_explanations",
    "model_id": "gpt-4",
    "evaluation_prompt_ids": ["clarity", "accuracy"],
    "judge_model": "gpt-4"
  }'
```

#### 5. View Performance Trends

Access the visualization dashboard to see performance changes over time:
- Navigate to http://localhost:8004
- Select the "Performance Timeline" view
- Filter for your model (gpt-4) and theme (science_explanations)
- Compare scores across different evaluation dates

### Example 2: Comparing Two Models Across Multiple Themes

    "theme": "summarization",
    "metadata": {
      "type": "research_paper",
      "field": "machine_learning"
    }
  }'
```

#### 2. Create Appropriate Evaluation Metrics

Create metrics for each theme:

    "metric_type": "summary_quality",
    "metadata": {
      "domain": "summarization"
    }
  }'
```

#### 3. Run Evaluation for First Model
