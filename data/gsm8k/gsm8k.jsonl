{"question": "Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?", "answer": "Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 for muffins, so she eats 3 + 4 = 7 eggs each day. That leaves 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell. At $2 per egg, she makes 9 * $2 = $18 per day at the farmer's market. The answer is 18."}
{"question": "Sam bought a dozen boxes of cookies, with 20 cookies in each box. After eating 35 cookies, he distributed the remaining cookies equally among 5 bags. How many cookies were in each bag?", "answer": "Sam bought 12 boxes of cookies, with 20 cookies per box. So he had 12 * 20 = 240 cookies initially. After eating 35 cookies, he had 240 - 35 = 205 cookies left. He put these cookies in 5 equal bags, so each bag had 205 / 5 = 41 cookies. The answer is 41."}
{"question": "Eliana has 5 oranges. She goes to the store to buy 3 more oranges and 2 apples. Then she shares the fruit equally between herself and her 2 friends. How many pieces of fruit does each person get?", "answer": "Eliana starts with 5 oranges. She buys 3 more oranges and 2 apples. So now she has 5 + 3 = 8 oranges and 2 apples, which is 8 + 2 = 10 pieces of fruit total. She shares the fruit equally among herself and her 2 friends, which means 3 people total. So each person gets 10 / 3 = 3â…“ pieces of fruit. But since we can't divide individual pieces of fruit, each person actually gets 3 pieces of fruit, with 1 piece left over. The answer is 3."}
{"question": "James decides to run 3 miles every day. After 2 weeks, he increases his distance to 5 miles every day. After 3 more weeks of running 5 miles every day, what is the total number of miles James has run?", "answer": "In the first 2 weeks, James runs 3 miles every day. So that's 2 weeks * 7 days per week * 3 miles per day = 42 miles in the first 2 weeks. Then for the next 3 weeks, he runs 5 miles every day. So that's 3 weeks * 7 days per week * 5 miles per day = 105 miles in the next 3 weeks. So in total, James ran 42 + 105 = 147 miles. The answer is 147."}

If he only has 3/4 cup of flour, how many more cups does he need to make exactly one batch?", "answer": "Kylar needs 2 cups of flour in total. He already has 3/4 cup of flour. So he needs 2 - 3/4 = 2 - 0.75 = 1.25 more cups of flour. The answer is 1.25."}
{"question": "Jennie has a rectangular garden with a length of 10 feet and a width of 8 feet. She wants to plant tomatoes in 3/4 of the garden and lettuce in the remaining space. How many square feet will be planted with lettuce?", "answer": "The area of Jennie's garden is 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet. She plants tomatoes in 3/4 of the garden, which is 3/4 * 80 = 60 square feet. The remaining space is 80 - 60 = 20 square feet. So she will plant 20 square feet with lettuce. The answer is 20."}
{"question": "Mark has 6 blue marbles, 7 red marbles, and 5 green marbles. If he randomly selects one marble, what is the probability that it is not blue? Express your answer as a simplified fraction.", "answer": "Mark has 6 blue marbles, 7 red marbles, and 5 green marbles. So he has 6 + 7 + 5 = 18 marbles in total. The number of marbles that are not blue is 7 + 5 = 12. So the probability of selecting a marble that is not blue is 12/18 = 2/3. The answer is 2/3."}
{"question": "A store has 200 items in total. 40% of the items are food, 25% are clothing, and the rest are toys. How many toy items are there in the store?", "answer": "The store has 200 items in total. 40% of the items are food, which means 40% * 200 = 0.4 * 200 = 80 items are food. 25% of the items are clothing, which means 25% * 200 = 0.25 * 200 = 50 items are clothing. The rest of the items are toys. So the number of toy items is 200 - 80 - 50 = 70. The answer is 70."}
{"question": "For a science experiment, Janelle needs to record the temperature at exactly 5:32 PM for 12 consecutive days. If she starts on a Thursday, on what day of the week will she take her final measurement?", "answer": "Janelle takes measurements for 12 consecutive days, starting on Thursday. 12 days later would be 1 week and 5 days later. 1 week later is Thursday again, and 5 more days would be Tuesday. So she will take her final measurement on Tuesday. The answer is Tuesday."}
{"question": "A book contains 800 pages. Darius reads 1/5 of the book on Monday, 3/8 of the book on Tuesday, and 1/4 of the book on Wednesday. How many pages does he have left to read after Wednesday?", "answer": "The book has 800 pages. On Monday, Darius reads 1/5 of the book, which is 1/5 * 800 = 160 pages. On Tuesday, he reads 3/8 of the book, which is 3/8 * 800 = 300 pages. On Wednesday, he reads 1/4 of the book, which is 1/4 * 800 = 200 pages. In total, he reads 160 + 300 + 200 = 660 pages. So he has 800 - 660 = 140 pages left to read after Wednesday. The answer is 140."}
